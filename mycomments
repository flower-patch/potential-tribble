  # Seam allowance, seam allowance.  This is easy to calculate with rectangular patches.
  # Triangles are trickier.  For our purposes, we are limiting them to 45, 45, 90.
  # We assume they will be cut by splitting a larger square in half on the diagonal.
  # We had done some math to calculate exactly how large that square should be, given the seam allowance and length of one side of the triangle.
  # n = new length of one side of big square that will give 2 triangles
  # s = seam allowance
  # x = length of straight side of triangle
  # n = x + 2s + s*sqrt(2)
  # this is derived from the basic formula: with a 45 45 90 triangle, the diagonal is found
  # with diagonal = straight side * sqrt(2)
  # This accounts for the space between the two triangles,
  # which is really hard to explain in words but instantly obvious visually
  # so I won't go into it here.
  # Then you have the original side length(x), plus the seam allowance on both sides of that (2s)
  # The issue is, with this pure math method, for a seam allowance of 0.25
  # you need to add 0.853553391" to each x.
  # But, if you actually measure it out, with graph paper, a very sharp pencil, and a quilting ruler
  # you get 0.875", or 7/8 of an inch.
  # 0.25" seam allowances are the gold standard for quilters, and that is what we are including in our MVP.
  # Every source I found online, whether a calculator or a descriptive tutorial, has said to add 7/8 of an inch.
  # While the difference between the calculation and physical measurement seems small (0.02145"), with 9 two-triangle squares in a block,
  # and 16 blocks in a 4x4 quilt, already the fabric we'd provide with math is about 1/4" too short on each side.
  # That means it is missing 23.868 square inches, or a patch nearly 5" square.
  # We hope to allow for quilters to select from a range of seam allowances later (eep, metric...).
  # I was hoping to calculate an average number to add to the calculation to account for this real-life difference.
  # But, across 4 of the most logical seam allowance choices (a: 1/4", b: 3/8", c: 1/2", d: 5/8")
  # the difference between math and reality was not consistent.
  # For a and b, the calculation came in too small.  For c and d, it was too large.
  # The average of all 4 differences between the calculation and reality ended up being that
  # the calculation is very slightly (0.00153) too large.
  # So, this does not help us at all with the issue that:
  # Most quilters will be using a 0.25" seam allowance, and following this calculation, they will not get enough fabric.
  # So I am just using 0.875".  Eventually, it should be separating it into another method.  We can change it later.

  # THE BIG QUESTION HERE IS:

  # THE MATH IS CORRECT...THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO THAT FORMULA
  # BUT THE WAY QUILTERS INTERACT WITH THE PHYSICAL FABRIC, THEY WILL NEED THAT EXTRA 0.00153 PER PATCH
  # SO IS THERE A MATHY WAY TO CONSISTENTLY COMPENSATE FOR THIS?

  # We can do fancy math.  We can do real-life tests of exactly what we need and have a different sort of calculation with every single seam allowance.
  # But the more I read up on quilting, I doubt most people would even want a seam allowance other than 0.25".
  # 90 pixels per inch

  # Cut and sew blocks have a seam allowance, cheaters have a seam allowance of 0.
  # Later, we will have to deal with bleeding out seam allowance on the edges of each block
  # so there can be another method that goes along with this.


# this would be nicer with a lot of tiny methods instead of one big one.  but.  i started out that way, with something like


# and realized that by breaking this up into tinier methods, those methods are no longer
# called on the whole svg, so it doesn't make sense for them to be in this class...
# that's some ruby theory that i will learn later as I refactor.

# Mason says put them in another class.

# these may all be methods on the block itself...but...since I have all my parsing methods here, it is easiest to put them here for now
